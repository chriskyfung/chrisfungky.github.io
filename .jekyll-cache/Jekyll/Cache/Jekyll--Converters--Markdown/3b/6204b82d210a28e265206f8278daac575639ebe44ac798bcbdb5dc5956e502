I"¥<p>The topic <em>‚ÄúConfigure Secure RDP using a Windows Bastion Host‚Äù</em> is from a challenging lab that I took in Qwiklabs (here is the <a href="https://www.qwiklabs.com/catalog?keywords=GSP303">link to the lab</a>). It was a tricky one that I failed and did it a few times of retakes to accomplish it. If you face the same challenge, I hope this blog article would help you. I will share my codes with you for your reference.</p>
