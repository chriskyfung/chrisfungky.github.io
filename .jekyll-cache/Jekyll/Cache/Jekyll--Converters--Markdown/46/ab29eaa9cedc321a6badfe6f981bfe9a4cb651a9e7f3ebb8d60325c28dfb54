I"%<p>Recently, I started publishing on Medium. I will gradually reissue my Qwiklabs articles to Medium platform. Not all, but some posts will be updated and/or upgraded with high resolution images. Although the contents may not be quite different, Medium is a great platform for readers, with no Ads, consistent styling and formatting, highlighting and interactive inline-commenting features.</p>

<p>I will keep my blogs as the primary sources, while I hope you can also enjoy the wonderful reading experience provided by Medium. Follow me on <a href="https://medium.com/@chriskyfung">Medium (@chriskyfung)</a>, while please keep track my blogs for the latest articles.</p>
