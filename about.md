## Bio

Hi, my name is Chris KY FUNG, an individual researcher in Engineering living in Hong Kong. Well, I am not a proficient programmer but I frequently code for my engineering research projects. I mainly used MATLAB when I was studying my MPhil in Compututional Intelligence. After graduated, I had participated a research on atomistic simulation of material processing with molecular dynamics (MD) for six years. To conduct such huge simulations, I had to deal with and paly with Linux servers and High-Performance Computing (HPC). My job also included developing models and data analysis with various programming languages.

The research experience let me know that programming and computer skills become increasingly important for a wide varity of student and research projects. Many students and researchers are, however, lack of a strong background in computer programming. The computer issues kill a lot of their time and energy when they have to review papers, conduct experiments, and writing reports and theses. This GitHub Page is to share my programming and computer skills and research experience for solving their headaches.

I am also a maker and the founder of a local community, called [Craftweeks](https://www.craftweeks.com). You may also visit www.craftweeks.com and [the YouTube channel](http://youtube.craftweeks.com), if you're interested in designing and making things.
