## Bio

Hi, my name is Chris FUNG, an individual researcher in Engineering living in Hong Kong. I am trying to transfer my old research blog to here.

I am also a maker and the founder of a local community, called [Craftweeks](https://www.craftweeks.com). Please also visit this website if you're interested in DIY, design and making things.
