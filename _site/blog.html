<p><strong>Tumblr</strong>  is a popular micro-blogging and social media platform, which is lightweight and highly-customizable with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is completely free without storage and bandwidth limits, like Facebook, Twitter, Blogger and Medium, but you can tailor-made your theme and use your custom domain name. It also allows monetizing with Google Adsense. Tumblr is a good alternative of WordPress and GitHub Page for hosting blog websites because no complex PHP or Jekyll knowledge is required. But the shortage of Tumblr includes slow page speed and limited SEO settings. On the whole, Tumblr is a great blogging platform for beginners. You can make use of the following plugins, tools, tips-and-tricks to enrich your Tumblr sites.</p>

      <p><p>Basically, Tumblr auto-generates Facebook Open Graph and/or Twitter Card markups to your blogs without a clear mechanism. I found that some of my Tumblr blog posts including the markups, but some of them not. Indeed, we have a lack of control over what kind of information to be auto-tagged. The Tumblr crawler may also pick up incorrect contents, especially og:type and og:image. You can use <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object/">Facebook’s Open Graph Object Debugger</a> to inspect the tags of your posts.</p>

      <p><p><a href="https://www.qwiklabs.com">Qwiklabs</a> is a great online self-paced learning platform for getting hands-on experience of the Google Cloud Platform. It has over 400 hands-on labs and quests to learn and practice.</p>

<p>As a Qwiklabs user, I figure out it is messy and damp to lookup unenrolled quests or incompleted labs from the Qwiklabs Catalog page or Search Results (https://www.qwiklabs.com/catalog). I desired to make a straight-forward way to  identify the catalogue items, by adding a green check-circle next to those completed. So, I tried to develop a solution named “<a href="https://github.com/chriskyfung/qwiklabs-complete-indicator">Qwiklabs Complete Indicator</a>”.</p>

      <p><p>For a long time, I have used PDF-Xchange Viewer to the PDF files of ebooks, papers, dissertations, etc. I prefer it rather than Adobe Reader. One of the reasons is because Xchange provides a JavaScript console, which can be invoked by hitting Ctrl+J. Thus, we can attempt to automate some annotations; for example, search and highlight words. You can find a source code from the knowledge base of Xchange (https://www.tracker-software.com/knowledgebase/385-How-do-I-Highlight-My-Search-Results). However, the original code can only find words that match exactly. Here, I modified the code in Line 10 and thereby it highlights words that contain the text to be searched.</p>

      <p><p>Prof. Uri Alon gave an inspiring talk in TED. He pointed out what most PhD students face in their postgraduate studies. We traditionally think science should be objective and rational. There should be a straight forward path going from questions to answers. But Aion this is rarely the situation in real life. He and he found many colleagues and his students feel depression and frustration because many times the things can go wrong. For examples, experiments generate unexpected results. Then, the research becomes to get away from the path and go into messy and unknown status, that he called a cloud.</p>

      <p><p>In a molecular dynamics study, simulation is often repeated with different sets of parameters, e.g. dimensions, velocity, initial pressure and temperature. If the parameters are defined as variables in the LAMMPS input script, we can change the value of the variables using the command line/terminal. So, we don’t need to modify the script each time.</p>

<p>I like storing each set of the simulation results to a well-labelled folder. This way makes systematic file management for finding the data in the future. For a long time, I did filing manually. It was gloomy and time consuming for creating and naming a new folder as well as moving the files. Recently, I found that the shell command can help to reduce the workload in the filing process.  The shell command has been introduced in my last post about how to send an email in the simulation process.</p>

<p>It is very useful as it allows to call the system commands and other programs.</p>

      <p><p>Impact factor is very useful for us to rank SCI journals. However, I can’t access Journal Citation Report (JCR) outside my campus. The browsed section losses if the session time out or restart the browser. Rather than search the information of a journal on the JCR site every time, I made a list to store the journal names and their impact factors in an excel file.  Although I can find the impact factors of the journals that I commonly read, the table does not help me to remember the ranks easily.</p>

<p>SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank (SJR) is an alternative journal rank service. It does not require logon or subscription, so I can access the journal rank at anytime and anywhere. Instead of impact factor, SJR offer indicators, such as H-index, SJR indicator, cites per document, etc.</p>

<p>Molecular dynamics simulations often take long computational times, from several hours to a few days. It is a boring job to monitor the progress of simulations. Very often, we switch to do other work on another computer, but you may be anxious to see the simulation results. So, how can we better spend our time and focus on our research work? Here is one solution to allow the LAMMPS to send you an email, so you can no longer actively checking the progress of simulations. It is also important to minimize the idle time and maximize the utility of your computer.</p>
