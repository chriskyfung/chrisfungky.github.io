[Qwiklabs](https://www.qwiklabs.com) is a great online self-paced learning platform for getting hands-on experience of Google Cloud Platform. It has over 400 hands-on labs and quests for learn and practice. 

## What is Qwiklabs

If you are not familiar with Qwiklabs, I suggest you watch this video made by Google Cloud Team to get a rough idea about using Qwiklabs for Hands-on Practice with Google Cloud.

After you logged in to Qwiklabs, you can see there are five training catalogies, i.e.
- Infrastructure & DevOps
- Websites & App Dev
- Big Data
- Machine Learning
- Security, Backup & Recovery

You can start your training based on your goal and purpose, or find the quests for Google Cloud Platform using the filter function available on the Catalog page. Qwiklabs grouped different kinds of labs into 56 quests for learning GCP, and divided them to 4 levels: Introductory, Fundammental, Advanced, and Expert. You may also look for the resources by search, but the results are sorted by relevance rather than an appropiate order for study or learning. As a result, I tried to organise the Qwiklabs quests to the diagram below. I hope this visual map will help you or any beginners to better seek your desired learning paths.

I spent about three months to take all the Qwiklabs quests for Google Cloud Platform.

## Custom Tool for Labelling Completed Labs and Quests

As a Qwiklabs user, I found it is messy and damp to lookup unenrolled quests or incompleted labs from the Qwiklabs Catalog page or Search Results (https://www.qwiklabs.com/catalog). I desired to make a straight-forward way to idenify the catalog items, by adding a green check-circle next to those completed. So, I tried to develop a solution named "[Qwiklabs Complete Indicator](https://github.com/chriskyfung/qwiklabs-complete-indicator)".

The prototyped tool can help you visually identify the completed catalog items with a green check-circle (<i class="fa fa-check-circle" style="color:green"></i>) showing at the end of a lab or quest title. A demo screenshot is shown below.
