The command `ls -i` shows the inode number of files

```php
echo `ls -i ./filepath`;
```

The command `find -inum` returns the filepath of a specific inode in the file system

```php
echo `find ./filepath -inum 55340444  `; 
```

With the parameter and the placeholder `-exec {}`, the command apply the second part to rename the specific inode file

```php
echo `find ./filepath -inum 55340444 -exec mv {} newfilepath \;`;
```
