The topic _"Configure Secure RDP using a Windows Bastion Host"_ is from a challenging lab that I took in Qwiklabs (here is the [link to the lab](https://google.qwiklabs.com/focuses/1737?parent=catalog)). It was a tricky one that I failed and did it a few times of retakes to accomplish it. If you have face the same challenge, I hope this blog article would be help you. I will share my codes with you for your reference.

[Qwiklabs](https://www.qwiklabs.com) has over 400 hands-on labs and is a great online self-paced learning Google Cloud Platform. Most exercises in Qwiklabs provide clear step-by-step instructions for you to follow and finish the labs, except a few Adcanced Challenge Labs. Those labs are not easy because they do not offer the "cookbook" steps. You have to figure out the solutions by yourself as the exercises for students who perpare for the [Google Cloud Certified Professional Cloud Architect](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-architect). The lab **GSP303** _"Configure Secure RDP using a Windows Bastion Host"_ is one of the challenge exercises.
